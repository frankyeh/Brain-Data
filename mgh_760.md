  **Methods**
  > A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 1000 and 2500 s/mm2. The number of diffusion sampling directions were 840 and 1680, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 0.76 mm. The slice thickness was 0.76 mm. The diffusion data were reconstructed in the MNI space at 0.5 mm using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (Yeh et al., Neuroimage, 58(1):91-9, 2011) to obtain the spin distribution function (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010).  A diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25 was used The output resolution of is 0.5 mm isotorpic. The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603--612 (2017)).

  To track the data, download DSI Studio at dsi-studio.labsolver.org and open the FIB.gz file in [Step T3 Fiber Tracking]. The figures were created by whole brain tracking of 500,000 tracks and cut at mid-brain and pons level using [Edit][Cut by slice][Cut Z+]
