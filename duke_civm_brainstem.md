  **Method**
  > A HARDI scheme was used, and a total of 120 diffusion sampling directions were acquired. The b-value was 4000 s/mm2. The in-plane resolution was 0.2 mm. The slice thickness was 0.2 mm. The b-table was checked by an automatic quality control routine to ensure its accuracy (Schilling et al. MRI, 2019). The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603--612 (2017)). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 0.4.


## Instructions
