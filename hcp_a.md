# Lifespan Human Connectome Project Aging (HCP-A) Study

The [HCP-A Study](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-lifespan-aging) planned to enroll 1,500+ healthy adults ages 36-100+. The purpose is to discover how individual experiences affect the ways in which different parts of the brain are connected and how these connections (the “connectome”) change across healthy adulthood.

# Methods
> A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 1500 and 3000 s/mm². The number of diffusion sampling directions was 93 and 92, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 1.5 mm. The slice thickness was 1.5 mm. The susceptibility artifact was estimated using reversed phase-encoding b0 by TOPUP from the Tiny FSL package (http://github.com/frankyeh/TinyFSL), a re-compilied version of FSL TOPUP (FMRIB, Oxford) with multi-thread support. The correction was conducted through the integrated interface in DSI Studio's ("Chen" release). The diffusion MRI data were rotated to align with the AC-PC line. The accuracy of b-table orientation was examined by comparing fiber orientations with those of a population-averaged template (Yeh et al. Neuroimage, 2018). The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603--612 (2017)). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. The tensor metrics were calculated. The analysis was conducted using the resource allocation (TG-CIS200026) at Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources (Towns, J. et al. Computing in science & engineering 16, 62-74  2014).

# Processing Scripts

**1. generate SRC files from NIFTI files**

First, copy all NIFTI, bval, bvec files in the same folder and run this script to generate SRC files (one for AP, one for PA)

```
#!/bin/bash
for sub in $(ls HCA8*98_AP.nii.gz)
do    
    dsi_studio --action=src --source=${sub} --other_source=${sub:0:25}99_AP.nii.gz
    dsi_studio --action=src --source=${sub:0:25}98_PA.nii.gz --other_source=${sub:0:25}99_PA.nii.gz
done
```

**2. TOPUP/EDDY and save corrected SRC files**

Correct artifacts using AP and PA SRC files and generate corrected AP-PA combined SRC files.
The script needs a number input that allows for running the task using clusters job arrary

```
#!/bin/bash
subs_ap=$(ls -Lr *AP.nii.gz.src.gz)
subs_ap=(${subs_ap// /})
subs_pa="${subs_ap[$1]:0:28}PA.nii.gz.src.gz"
if [ ! -e $sub_pa ]; then
     echo "." > ${sub_pa}_not_found.txt
else    
     echo "processing ${subs_ap[$1]}"
     dsi_studio --action=rec --source=${subs_ap[$1]} --rev_pe=${subs_pa} --cmd="[Step T2][File][Save Src File]=${subs_pa:0:10}.src.gz"
fi
```

The following is the job array to run the above script using sbatch. The script needs an the file name of the script to run the job array.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00
#SBATCH -p RM-shared
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node 8
#SBATCH --mem=15GB
#SBATCH --array=0-999
set -x
sh $1 $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
```

**3. reconstruction**

The following command generate native space FIB files for automatic fiber tracking
```
dsi_studio --action=rec --source=*.src.gz
```

The following command generate template space FIB files for correlational tractography
```
dsi_studio --action=rec --source=*.src.gz --method=7 --template=0 --record_odf=1 --dti_no_high_b=1
```


**4. automatic fiber tracking**

The following script for a job arrary to runs fiber tracking on all native-space FIB file. 

```
#!/bin/bash
subs=$(ls -L *.fib.gz)
subs=(${subs// /})
echo "processing ${subs[$1]}"
dsi_studio --action=atk --export_template_trk=1 --source=${subs[$1]}
```

**5. create connectometry database for correlation tractography**

The following command create connectometry databases from template-space FIB file

```
dsi_studio --action=atl --source=. --cmd=db --template=../../HCP1065.1mm.fib.gz 
```
