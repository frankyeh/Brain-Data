# Introduction

The [Lifespan Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) Study](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/lifespan-developing-human-connectome-project) planned to enroll 1500 Subjects at age 20-44 weeks post-conception. The purpose is to link together imaging, clinical, behavioural, and genetic information..

  **Methods**
  > A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 400 ,1000 and 2600 s/mm². The number of diffusion sampling directions were 64, 88, and 128, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 1.5 mm. The slice thickness was 1.5 mm. The susceptibility artifact was estimated using reversed phase-encoding b0 by TOPUP from the Tiny FSL package (http://github.com/frankyeh/TinyFSL), a re-compilied version of FSL TOPUP (FMRIB, Oxford) with multi-thread support. The correction was conducted through the integrated interface in DSI Studio's ("Chen" release). The diffusion MRI data were rotated to align with the AC-PC line. The accuracy of b-table orientation was examined by comparing fiber orientations with those of a population-averaged template (Yeh et al. Neuroimage, 2018). The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603--612 (2017)). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. The tensor metrics were calculated. The analysis was conducted using the resource allocation (TG-CIS200026) at Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources (Towns, J. et al. Computing in science & engineering 16, 62-74  2014).
