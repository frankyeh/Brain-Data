# Lifespan Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) Study

The [dHCP study](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/lifespan-developing-human-connectome-project) planned to enroll 1500 Subjects at age 20-44 weeks post-conception. The purpose is to link together imaging, clinical, behavioural, and genetic information..

**Methods**
  > A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 400 ,1000 and 2600 s/mm². The number of diffusion sampling directions were 64, 88, and 128, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 1.5 mm. The slice thickness was 1.5 mm. The images were denoised and corrected for Gibbs ringing, motion, eddy current, and susceptibility artifact using [the diffusion SHARD pipeline](https://biomedia.github.io/dHCP-release-notes/dwi-shard.html). A quality check was conducted using neighboring DWI correcltion (NDC) (Yeh, Neuroimage. 2019 Nov 15;202:116131). 34 out of 758 scans were excluded due to their low NDC values identified by a median value based outlier detector. The accuracy of b-table orientation was examined by comparing fiber orientations with those of a population-averaged template (Yeh et al. Neuroimage, 2018). The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603--612 (2017)). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. The tensor metrics were calculated. The analysis was conducted using the resource allocation (TG-CIS200026) at Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources (Towns, J. et al. Computing in science & engineering 16, 62-74  2014).

- [724 FIB files](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yehfc_pitt_edu/EjTFYS254-ZJpHOiyb3dQnYBYKSIrsSp2WaymT9ZGAstGA?e=hHWVWT) (Ready-to-track using [DSI Studio](https://dsi-studio.labsolver.org))

- [724 SRC files](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yehfc_pitt_edu/EpU-Q0UfT41Koq0hQSAAJDMBvSVaWp8DjRqVagvjOcqWUA?e=fmDWQE)

  These SRC files are preprocessed results from [the diffusion SHARD pipeline](https://biomedia.github.io/dHCP-release-notes/dwi-shard.html). The background signals are zeroed and image dimension cropped. The data are largely reduced and CANNOT be reversed back to the original data distribution.

# Processing Steps

**1. generate SRC files from NIFTI files**

Copy all NIFTI (DWI and mask), bval, bvec files to the same folder and use DSI Studio's GUI Batch function [Batch Processing[Step B2b: NIFTI to SRC (Single Folder)]

**2. reconstruction**

This was done using DSI Studio GUI. Click on [Step T2 Reconstruction] and select all SRC files.
1. [Step T2a][Edit][Open] to load mask 
2. [Edit][Crop Background]
3. [Run Reconstruction]


**3. fiber Tracking**

The following script for a job arrary to runs fiber tracking on all FIB file. 

```
#!/bin/bash
subs=$(ls -L *.fib.gz)
subs=(${subs// /})
echo "processing ${subs[$1]}"
singularity exec dsistudio_latest.sif dsi_studio --action=atk --export_template_trk=1 --source=${subs[$1]}
```

The following is the job array to run the above script using sbatch. The script needs an the file name of the script to run the job array.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00
#SBATCH -p RM-shared
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node 8
#SBATCH --mem=15GB
#SBATCH --array=0-999
set -x
sh $1 $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
```
