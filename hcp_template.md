# Population-Averaged Diffusion MRI Template

The population averaged templates are averaged from a group of subjects. The voxel-wise metrics are stored in NIFTI files, whereas the ready-to-track data are stored in FIB files, which can be opened in DSI Studio to perform fiber tracking.

The HCP1065 registration is based on the nonlinear ICBM152 2009a space. The template can be used with the T1W images from Montreal Neurological Institute: <http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~vfonov/icbm/2009/> or histology images from the Big Brain data: <https://bigbrain.loris.ca/main.php?test_name=brainvolumes>\
The HCP 1065 template was constructed from a total of 1065 subjects' diffusion MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (2017 Q4, 1200-subject release). There were 575 female (others male). Age ranges from 22 to 37 with a mean of 28.74, Q1=26, median=29, Q4=32. A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 1000, 2000, 3000 s/mm2. The number of diffusion sampling directions were 90, 90, and 90, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 1.25 mm. The slice thickness was 1.25 mm. The diffusion data were reconstructed in the MNI space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (Yeh et al., Neuroimage, 58(1):91-9, 2011) to obtain the spin distribution function (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010). A diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.7 was used, and the output resolution was 1 mm. The analysis was conducted using DSI Studio (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org).

The HCP1065 DTI template is redistributed from FSL (<https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases>) under [FSL main license](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Licence). These templates were derived from 1065 HCP subjects. Diffusion tensors were fitted using the b=1000 s/mm2 data after gradient non-linearities correction. Each tensor was transformed into MNI space using the HCP subject-specific volumetric transformations, after appropriate re-orientation (Alexander et al, IEEE TMI, 2001). The FA of the arithmetic mean of all MNI-transformed tensors was obtained. The work was carried out by S. Warrington, S. Jbabdi, S. Smith, S. Sotiropoulos. Data were provided by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.

M: 372 F:470 ages: 20~40 (2015 Q4, 900-subject release)

The HCP842 registration used FSL's FA template as the template space. It is the old ICBM152 space.

The HCP-842 template was constructed using a total of 842 subjects' diffusion MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (2015 Q3, 900-subject release). The diffusion images were acquired using a multishell diffusion scheme. The b-values were 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm2. The number of diffusion sampling directions were 90, 90, and 90. The in-plane resolution was 1.25 mm. The slice thickness was 1.25 mm. The diffusion data were reconstructed in the MNI space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (Yeh et al., Neuroimage, 58(1):91-9, 2011) to obtain the spin distribution function (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010). A diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25 was used, and the output resolution was 1 mm. The atlas was constructed by averaging the SDFs of the 842 individual subjects.


## DSI Template

The following data were group average of normal subjects scanned by DSI 258-direction acquisition.

A group average template was constructed from a total of 32 subjects. The diffusion images were acquired on a SIEMENS Prisma_fit scanner using a diffusion sequence (dMRI_dir258_1 ). TE=99.2 ms, and TR=2490 ms. A diffusion spectrum imaging scheme was used, and a total of 257 diffusion sampling were acquired. The maximum b-value was 4010 s/mm². The in-plane resolution was 2 mm. The slice thickness was 2 mm. The accuracy of b-table orientation was examined by comparing fiber orientations with those of a population-averaged template (Yeh et al. Neuroimage, 2018). The diffusion data were reconstructed in the MNI space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (Yeh et al., Neuroimage, 58(1):91-9, 2011) to obtain the spin distribution function (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010).  A diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25 was used. The output resolution in diffeomorphic reconstruction was 2 mm isotorpic. The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603–612 (2017)). The tensor metrics were calculated.
