- [3-mm DSI 203-direction data (n=90)](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yehfc_pitt_edu/Eh3uFZ8UdfREmbAXTkRbZE4BeZBEI_DaZlkx01BApzuXsQ?e=to0Hq9)

The diffusion images were acquired on a SIEMENS Trio scanner using a 2D EPI diffusion sequence. TE=142 ms, and TR=9100 ms. A diffusion spectrum imaging scheme was used, and a total of 203 diffusion sampling were acquired. The maximum b-value was 6000 s/mm2. The in-plane resolution was 2.9 mm. The slice thickness was 2.9 mm.

- [2-mm DSI 203-direction data (n=1)](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yehfc_pitt_edu/EmEs7GztOl1InBsGv0wEv0QBbhrqG3hzIX4dOUTkk__v9Q?e=EIKnTy)

The diffusion images were acquired on a SIEMENS Trio scanner using a 2D EPI diffusion sequence. TE=131 ms, and TR=11500 ms. A diffusion spectrum imaging scheme was used, and a total of 203 diffusion sampling were acquired. The maximum b-value was 4000 s/mm2. The in-plane resolution was 1.9 mm. The slice thickness was 1.9 mm.
