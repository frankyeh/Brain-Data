## 📄 Overview

UCSF-PDGM provides MRI data from **501 adult patients** with histopathologically confirmed **grade II-IV diffuse gliomas**, all acquired **preoperatively** using a **standardized 3T MRI protocol**. This dataset extends previous public resources (e.g., TCGA-GBM, BraTS) by including:

- Advanced MRI techniques: **3D sequences, ASL perfusion, and HARDI diffusion**
- Genomic biomarkers: **IDH mutation and MGMT methylation**
- Expert-reviewed, multi-compartment **tumor segmentation**

## 🧠 Imaging Protocol

- Scanner: GE Discovery 750 (3T), 8-channel head coil  
- Sequences:
  - 3D T2, T2/FLAIR, SWI
  - DWI and HARDI (55-direction)
  - Pre/post-contrast T1
  - 3D ASL perfusion
- Contrast agents: Gadobutrol (0.1 mL/kg), Gadoterate (0.2 mL/kg)

## ⚙️ Preprocessing

- **DWI Processing**: Eddy correction + DTIFIT (FSL 6.0.2) → MD, AD, RD, FA maps  
- **Registration**: All contrasts resampled to T2/FLAIR space (1 mm³) via ANTs  
- **Skull-stripping**: Deep learning model ([GitHub](https://github.com/ecalabr/brain_mask))

## 🧩 Tumor Segmentation

- Initial segmentation using ensemble models from BraTS challenge  
- Manual corrections by radiologists, reviewed by experts  
- Segmented regions:
  - Enhancing tumor  
  - Non-enhancing/necrotic tumor  
  - FLAIR abnormality (edema)

## 🔬 Research Impact

UCSF-PDGM complements existing glioma datasets and enhances opportunities for:

- **AI-based tumor segmentation**
- **Radiogenomic prediction of IDH and MGMT status**
- **Generalizable models** using standardized, high-resolution imaging

We hope this dataset will advance AI applications in neuro-oncology and inspire new methods for glioma analysis.
