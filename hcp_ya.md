# Introduction

The data are originally from the minimally-preprocessed dMRI data from WU-Minn HCP Consortium and converted to DSI Studio SRC files format. The SRC file stores the minimum information needed for diffusion MRI processing, including the DWI data, image resolution, and the b-table. The SRC file can be converted back to 4D NIFTI in DSI Studio.

# License

  **Methods**
  > A group average template was constructed from a total of 930 subjects. A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm2. The number of diffusion sampling directions were 90, 90, and 90, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 1.25 mm. The slice thickness was 1.25 mm. The diffusion data were reconstructed in the MNI space using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (Yeh et al., Neuroimage, 58(1):91-9, 2011) to obtain the spin distribution function (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010). A diffusion sampling length ratio of 2.5 was used, and the output resolution was 1 mm. The analysis was conducted using DSI Studio (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org).

## MGH-USC 

This data set was originally from the connectome db website (https://db.humanconnectome.org/). The MGH HCP team has released diffusion imaging and structural imaging data acquired from 35 young adults using the customized MGH Siemens 3T Connectome scanner, which has 300 mT/m maximum gradient strength for diffusion imaging.
