- FIB Files

  These files can be opened in DSI Studio \[Step T2 Fiber tracking\] to generate tractography.Â The gradient distortion was corrected using two different phase encoding scans. The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1. The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603--612 (2017)).
