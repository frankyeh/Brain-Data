  **Methods**
  >  A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 1,000 and 2,000 s/mm2. The number of diffusion sampling directions were 30 and 30, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 2 mm. The slice thickness was 2 mm. The b-table was checked by an automatic quality control routine to ensure its accuracy (Schilling et al. MRI, 2019) . The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25.

  The SRC files can be processed by DSI Studio to generate native-space or template-space FIB file.

- Demographic and Cognitive data: 

  Cam-CAN includes a rich demographics and cognitive data. You can request access at the [CamCAN data portal](https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/datarequest.php).
